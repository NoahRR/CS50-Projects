### implement a tideman election in C
- A tideman election improves on the "plurality" election method. Every voter votes for their first, second, and third choice, and the tideman algorith designates a winner from there.
- Understanding how a tideman election works is fairly complicated, to get an idea, look at my code in "tideman.c" or view the CS50 prompt.
